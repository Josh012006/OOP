## About the project
This is a very primitive e commerce website. It is done using the basic languages like HTML, CSS and JS(with the DOM).

I particularly like this project because it helped me understand and dive deeper into the concept of Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript. I created classes for the products, the cart and the cart items. I also used the local storage to save the cart. The website is responsive and the user can add products to the cart, remove them, see the total price and even buy them. 

Even though it is not complex, it displays that I have good foundations in web development.

## Hope you enjoy.
Give it a try and I await the feedback.
